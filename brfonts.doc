BRFONTS.DOC
-----------

This library contains several revised/new fonts, etc. for use with
Bradford:

1) FONTT.BIN is a revised version of the original Font 1  ("T" for
   "Typewriter"). A number of characters have been changed to make
   them more like the standard PICA typeface, and the use of
   serifs is more consistent.  I find this consistency more 
   pleasing to the eye than the original version.

2) FONTO.BIN is a slightly revised version of the original Font 9,
   the "Orator" style.  The revisions include removal of serifs on
   several characters to be consistent, since this is a plain
   Gothic, or "san-serif" typeface.

3) FONTM.BIN is a new miniature typeface which I created for a
   label-making application where I wanted several sizes of type.
   It was inspired by the small capitals used for the "lower-case"
   portion of Font 8.  Try it with a Character Width of 1 - perfect
   for printing contracts!!

4) FONTMB. is the source list for FONTM.BIN.  Since BRADCON ignores
   everything to the right of the ninth column, I put in the line
   numbers, etc. as an aid to editting.

5) ALLFONTS.1 is simply a revised and expanded version of the test
   text distributed earlier.  Printing it provides a five page
   reference showing all of the type fonts with the most useful
   combinations of character widths, proportional spacing, etc.

respectively, or you can rename them to FONT1.BIN and FONT9.BIN,
replacing the original versions, as I have done.
